## Reflection
This was a simple 3 day project built during the year. Project goals included were to use technologies learned up to this point such as Django, React and SCSS. I also wanted to familiarize myself with other libraries such as Redux, Knox authentication.

At the end of the project, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Redux, Lodash, Axios, Typescript, Python, Django, Django-rest-knox and Djangorestframeworks. I used ```bash yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript``` for the initial set up.
